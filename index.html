            Brewer.js is a tool that eases all sorts of tasks related to the management of 
            stylesheets and javascript source files. From a single command, it takes charge of :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compilation of coffee-script (or <em>iced</em>) source files to javascript</li>
            <li>Compilation of LESS or Stylus files to CSS</li>
            <li>
              Bundling different files (javascript or CSS) into a single file (optionally compressing it)
              while maintaining references and their proper ordering.
            </li>
            <li>Watching a directory for changes, triggering any or all of the above.</li>

      <section class="installation"> 
        <h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          To setup Brewer.js, make sure you have 
          <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager">installed Node.js.</a>
          When this is done, enter the terminal and type.
        </p>
        <pre><span class="prompt">$</span> npm install -g brewer</pre>
        
        <p>
          The <code>-g</code> flag is used to make the installation global, so you get access to the <code>brake</code>
          executable. Then, from a project directory you wish to manage using Brewer.js
        </p>
        <pre><span class="prompt">$</span> brake init [&lt;template name&gt;]</pre>
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;template name&gt;</code> part is optional. Anyway, for the moment, there is only <em>one</em> 
          template available, <strong>lesscoffee</strong>, which is also the default. This template sets up LESS and 
          Coffeescript support for the current directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          What this does is create a <a href="#brewfile">Brewfile</a> in the current directory, according to the template
          provided and run <code>brake make</code> (see <a href="#CLI">CLI Usage</a>) on it.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="usage">
        <h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
        <h2 id="brewfile">Configuring using a Brewfile</h2><br />
        <p>
          A <strong>Brewfile</strong> is a file that sits at the root folder of your project, named, 
          well, "Brewfile", which syntax is plain <a href="http://coffeescript.org">Coffeescript</a>. 
          It is used to specify the structure of the project to Brewer.js, so it knows what to do when you tell 
          it to <code>make</code>, <code>watch</code> or <code>clean</code>. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Packages</h3>
        <p>At the top-level of the Brewfile, the following functions are available :</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/1839758.js?file=example.coffee"></script>
        
        <p>Those two functions can be used interchangeably with <code>js</code> or <code>css</code> to be more concise. The 
          <code>package_name</code> is used to identify certain parts of a project, in case you would like to run 
          <code>$ brake make package_name</code>. A <strong>Package</strong> is a conceptual component of a project in which you 
          can define <strong>bundles</strong> and in which files can <em>import</em> each other. A file contained in a package 
          can really be anywhere on the file system -- a package is not bound to a specific directory.</p>
          
        <p>Package can receive options, which can be specified in one of two ways :</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/1839758.js?file=rw-example.coffee"></script>
        
        <p>The <code>build</code> option specifies where to put bundles aggregated from source files, and <code>compress</code> &hellip; 
          well, I think you can guess that one.</p>
        <p>
        <code>@options</code> is a method available in the package definition body, that specifies additional options for the 
        package. Another such method is <code>@bundles(bundle1, bundle2, ...)</code> which specifies file names for bundles in 
        the package (see <strong>Bundles</strong> below). These two methods are prefixed with a <code>@</code>, meaning that they are members 
        of the package body context. Other methods of this kind are available, such as those to define <strong>Sources</strong> 
        in a package.</p>
        
        <h5>Sources</h5>
        <p>Sources represent a folder on the file system, where files can be found. One or many can exist within a package, 
          providing it with files to compile, bundle and compress. A source can be of one of many available types : 
          <em>coffeescript</em> (or <em>icedcoffeescript</em>), <em>javascript</em>, <em>css</em>, <em>less</em> or <em>stylus</em>. One restriction 
          about this source type is that a package can only contain sources that are either of its own type, or that can be compiled into 
          its own type (remember a package also have a type).</p>
        
        <p>Now for a real-world example, so we don't get lost too quickly. Say we want to make a cool looking website using 
          jQuery, Bootstrap and Chosen. Each of these libraries have their own source files, of different types and we want 
          to manage all of that neatly. Here is the directory structure :</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/1839758.js?file=rw-example-struct.txt"></script>
        
        <p>So there are files that ends up as javascript and those that ends up as css. Let's write a Brewfile that takes 
          this structure into account.</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/1839758.js?file=rw-example2.coffee"></script>
        
        <p>So what we're looking at now is a package for javascripts that looks for coffeescript files in <code>./coffee</code>, 
          as well as for javascript files in <code>./vendor</code>, <code>./vendor/chosen</code> and <code>./vendor/bootstrap/js</code>. Now let's look 
          at what a bundle would look like :</p>
          
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/1839758.js?file=rw-home.coffee"></script>
        
        <p>If we had been running <code>brake watch</code> while we wrote that script and saved it, we would have seen a file appear, 
          named <code>./js/home.js</code>, containing an aggregate file of jquery, chosen and our little script compiled into javascript. 
          Since we didn't provide the <code>output</code> option, a compiled javascript version of just <code>coffee/home.coffee</code> can be found 
          in <code>./_cache</code>. If we wanted it to appear somewhere more meaningful, we could set the <code>output</code> option on a source 
          directive. A more complete example of the above could be :</p>
          
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/1839758.js?file=rw-example3.coffee"></script>
        
        <p>This dedicates a directory <code>./build</code>, to contain files that would be deployed, and all source files in separate 
          directories. You may have noticed we used <code>@css</code> and <code>@js</code> names to mean stylesheets and javascript respectively. 
          As we said earlier, those are drop-in replacements.</p>
        
        <h2 id="CLI">Command-line interface</h2><br />
        
        <p>The command-line interface for brewer provides a few methods to manage your asset project:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <pre><span class="prompt">$</span> brake init [&lt;template_name&gt;]</pre>
            <p>
              This command tells brewer to make a Brewfile in the current directory, according to the template 
              provided, and make an initial directory structure to support the project.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <pre><span class="prompt">$</span> brake [all|&lt;package&gt;*]</pre>
            <p>
              This command tells brewer to look for files to compile (coffeescript, less, etc.) into their 
              javascript or css counterparts, product bundles and compress them if necessary. This intelligently 
              selects only the tasks that needs to be done, skipping files that haven't change.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <pre><span class="prompt">$</span> brake clean [&lt;package&gt;*]</pre>
            <p>
              This command tells brewer to delete files that strongly depends on source files, such as those 
              that are completely derived from the compilation of another file, bundles and their compressed 
              counterparts.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <pre><span class="prompt">$</span> brake watch</pre>
            <p>
              This command tells brewer to first run `brake all` on the current directory and watch for 
              changes (file content change, new files, moved files or deleted files).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <pre><span class="prompt">$</span> brake install</pre>
            <p>
              This command tells Brewer.js to install all missing Node.js modules that it needs to work properly
              with the current project. For instance, had I put a few <code>@coffeescript</code> source directives 
              in the project's Brewfile, Brewer.js will make sure the coffee-script module is available, installing 
              it under its own project directory if not.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
