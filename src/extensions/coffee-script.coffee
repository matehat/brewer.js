# ### Coffeescript extension
#
# The coffee-script extension works by compiling all *.coffee* files
# contained in a source of type *coffeescript*, into an output 
# directory. That compiled file is marked as impermanent and depends on 
# the original *.coffee* file. Imports specified into a *.coffee* file
# are carried over to the compiled *javascript* file.

# Underscore, CLI utilities and the *Source* class are loaded
_ = require 'underscore'
{debug, finished, error} = require '../command'
{Source} = require '../source'

# The *Source* class is subclassed and essential 
# [class variables](source.html#section-2) are specified.
