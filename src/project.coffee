# ## The *Project* class
#
# This module exports the *Project* class. A *Project* object
# is tightly coupled with, as well as initialized with, a 
# [Brewfile](brewfile.html). It contains a set of 
# packages, as well as cross-project configurations, such as *vendor libraries*.
# Vendor libraries are entities that can export one or many 
# [sources](source.html), of different types, which can be used when 
# aggregating bundles. 
#
# > *TODO*: Vendor libraries are currently *not documented*, because, 
# although they are functional, there is no easy way for someone 
# to include them in their project. This is implemented mostly to prepare
# for an upcoming feature : *[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew)-style 
# formulas*

# Underscore, core modules and CLI utilities are loaded.

# The Project class is initialized with a Brewfile, which immidiately
# calls the `setup` instance method. There, the `configs` function
# exported from [brewfile.coffee](brewfile.html) is called with the
# given brewfile as argument, to obtain an project configuration object.
# This object is then given default values and used to initialize
# the project vendor libraries and packages. Packages are inserted as
# *array elements* in the project.
