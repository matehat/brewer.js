# ## The *Package* class
#
# This module exports the *Package* class. A *Package* is a conceptual
# container within which source files can reference each other as "imports".
# Packages can produce *bundles*, a particular *[File](file.html)* which 
# content is the result of recursively aggregating all imports from a file, 
# from its imports, and so on. Packages can have one or many 
# *[Sources](source.html)*, in which it looks for files to aggregate bundles.
# Packages have a type (*javascript* or *css*) which is the type of bundles
# it produces.
#
# Objects of this class are not meant to be initialized directly, but rather
# produced at the initialization of a *[Project](project.html)*.

# ### Subclassing
# 
# The *Package* class can be subclassed for different types of bundled files
# by specifying a few class properties and the compression mechanism.
# 
# * `@type`
#   
#   The source type of the *Package* subclass. This implies that bundles are
#   aggregated from source files of this type, and such package can be created
#   in a project by using, for instance, a `@stylesheets' statement in a Brewfile.
#
# * `@aliases`
#
#   A list of aliases for the defined `@type`. This specifies
#   a list of drop-in replacement names.
#
# * `@compressedext`
#
#   The suffix appended to an access path when creating
#   a compressed counterpart to a bundle. This is not used if the `@compress`
#   instance variable is an *Underscore template string*.
#
# * `@ext`
#
#   The suffix appended to an access path when creating a bundle from
#   a source file.

# Underscore, brewer.js classes and CLI utilities are loaded up.

  # The Package class needs to maintain a registry of its subclasses, which 
  # maps types to subclasses. `Package.extend(packages*)` adds subclasses to 
  # the registry, and `Package.create(options, sources, vendor)` creates an 
  # instance of the appropriate subclass, given `options.type` is registered.
